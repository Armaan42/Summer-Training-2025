Polish notation:
    This type of notation was introduced by the polish notation mathematician lukasiewicz.
    - polish notation in data strucuture tells us about different ways to write an arithmeatic expression

    - An arithematic expression contains 2 things:
        1. Operator:
            operator is a symbol that represents a specific operation to be performed.
            e.g., +, -, *, /, ^, %

        2. Operand:
            Operand is a value or a variable on which an operation is performed by an operator
            e.g., 0 to 9, a to z, A to Z

- There are mainly three types of Polish notation:
    1. Infix notation:
        - This polish notation in data structure states that the operator is written in between the operands.
        e.g., ( a + b ) x c ( a + b ) x c
                a + b - c + d

    2. Prefix notation:
        - This notation in data structure states that the operator should be present as prefix or before the operands.

        e.g., + a b
            + - a b c + - a b c
            x a b x a b
        - 
    3. postfix notation:
        - This notation in data structure states that the operator should be present as a after the operands

        - Postfix notataion is a computer understanable format.

        e.g., 
        a b -
        a b / c d /
