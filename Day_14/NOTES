Queue is define inside <Queue> header file.
- There are mainly 4 types of queue:

1. simple queue

2. Circular queue
    - The last position is connected back to the first to make a circle.
    - It prevents wastage of space in a linear queue.

3. Priority queue
    - Elements are based on priority, not just an order.
    - Higher priority elements are dequeued before lower ones.

4. Double ended queue (Dequeue):
    - Insertion and deletion can happen at both ends( front and rear ).
    4.1 Input restricted queue: Insertion at only one end.
    4.2 Output restricted queue: Deletion from only one end.

Searching:
    - search element one by one.
    They are mainly two type:
        1. Linear Search:
            search element one by one:
            complexity: 0(n)

            Algorithm:
            1. Start from the first element
            2. Compare each element with the target.
            3. If a match is found, return the index.
            4. If end is reached without a match, return -1 (not found).

        2. Binary Search:
            Divide and conquer on sorted array.
            complexity: n(log(n))

            Array must be sorted.

    Sorting:
        1. Selection sorting
        2. Bubble sorting
            Algorithm:
            
            1. Start from the first element.
            2. Compare each other of adjacent elements
            3. If the left element is greater, swap them.
            4. Repeat the process for all element.
            5. After each pass, the largest element bubbles to the end.
            6. continue for n-1 passes or until no swaps are needed.

            Time complexity:

                Best case: O(n)
                Worst case: O(n^2)
                Average case: O(n^2)
