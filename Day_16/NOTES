Graph:
    A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.

Real life examples:
    1. Social Networks
    2. Google maps
    3. Network topologies

Main types of Graph:
    1. Undirected
    2. Directed
    3. Weighted
    4. Cyclic

Representation of 2D matrix
    1. Adjacency matrix:
        A 2D array of size V x V, where V is the number of vertices.

            - matrix[i][j] = 1: Indicates an edge exists between vertex i and j.
            - matrix[i][j] = 0: Indicates no edges exists between vertex i and j.

    2. Adjacency list:
